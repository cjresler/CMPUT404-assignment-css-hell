Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

You will skin 3 project gutenberg stories with custom CSS.

For this part, I commented out the existing CSS at the top of the HTML files of the books that I chose. Aside from that I did not modify the html files at all.

You will skin 2 versions of a possible professional homepage for your
self with 2 versions of CSS.
